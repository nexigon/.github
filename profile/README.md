# Secure Remote Access & OTA Updates for Your Fleet

**Troubleshoot devices in seconds. Deploy updates with confidence.**

Nexigon provides a foundational device management layer for you to build upon:

- **Remote Access**: Securely access devices without complex VPN and firewall setups.
- **OTA Updates**: Compatible with best-in-class OSS solutions such as [Rugix](https://github.com/silitics/rugix), [RAUC](https://github.com/rauc/rauc), and others.
- **Configuration**: Easily configure devices remotely through custom JSON properties.
- **Telemetry**: Observe your fleet in real-time and identify issues before they become problems.

While the Nexigon backend is propriety, **all on-device components are open-source**.

Our open-source components and commitments include:

- [Rugix](https://github.com/silitics/rugix): OTA update tooling that supports robust **A/B system updates**, highly efficient **delta updates**, built-in **device state management**, and more. Works with Debian, Yocto, Buildroot, and others.
- [Rugix Bakery](https://github.com/silitics): Build system for custom Linux distributions based on Debian or Alpine Linux. Allows you to build and ship production-ready images with built-in OTA update support in hours, not weeks.
